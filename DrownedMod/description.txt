This is a mod that makes getting your own drowned world easier

It is a mod to flood your world.
Use Calamity Mod for the best experience and you MUST be on a large world.

You can change the flood type and disable the initial flood (for if your world was drowned with tEdit or something).

Now with universal world size support AND extra small/extra large world.

DO NOT MINE TOO FAST! THE GAME MIGHT DIE IF YOU DO!

Blue jellyfish will drop 3-5 gel while green, pink and blood drop 1-3

If you want to know what I mean by Drowned world watch Hectique's playlist of it at:
