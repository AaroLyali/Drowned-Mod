This is a mod that makes getting your own drowned world easier

It is a mod to flood your world.
Use Calamity Mod and you MUST be on a large world.

(V1.0.0.102 because I didn't have a github account when I made this but now I do so I wanted to add that. (that also allows for an icon I think (at least it seems that way)))

if you want to know what I mean by Drowned world watch Hectique's playlist of it at:
