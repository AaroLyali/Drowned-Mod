This is a mod that makes getting your own drowned world easier

It is a mod to flood your world.
Use Calamity Mod for the best experience and you MUST be on a large world.
If you don't use a large world it will hang at filling the first layer.

If you want to know what I mean by Drowned world watch Hectique's playlist of it at:
