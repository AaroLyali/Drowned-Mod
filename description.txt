This is a mod that makes getting your own drowned world easier

It is a mod to flood your world.
Use Calamity Mod for the best experience and you MUST be on a large world.

Now with config!

You can change the flood type and disable the initial flood (for if your world was drowned with tEdit or something).

DO NOT MINE TOO FAST! THE GAME WILL DIE IF YOU DO!

If you want to know what I mean by Drowned world watch Hectique's playlist of it at:
