This is a mod that makes getting your own drowned world easier

It is a mod to flood your world.
Use Calamity Mod for the best experience and you MUST be on a large world.

Now with config!

If you want to use a small world you need to specify in the config.
You can also change the flood type and disable the initial flood (for if your world was drowned with tEdit).
*DISCLAMER MEDIUM WORLD DESN'T WORK YET!*
